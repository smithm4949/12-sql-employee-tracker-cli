# Challenge 12 - SQL Employee Tracker

## Description

This weeks challenge is to create a CLI in node.js (using inquirer and mySQL2) that allows a user to interact with a databse. This should include, for example, the ability to view all employees, view all roles, and create and update records in those tables.

## Installation and Deployment

This application is not deployed nor hosted and there is no one way for other users to install it. For demonstration purposes, functionality can be viewed in the section below.
